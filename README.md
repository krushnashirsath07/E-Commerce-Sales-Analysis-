🪔 Diwali Sales Analysis – Python Data Analytics Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Diwali sales data using Python to uncover customer buying behavior during the festive season. The main objective was to identify high-performing product categories, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns so businesses can optimize sales strategies and marketing campaigns during festive seasons.

Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, the dataset was transformed into meaningful insights that highlight who buys what, from where, and why.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python – Data analysis & scripting

NumPy – Numerical computing

Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

Matplotlib – Data visualization (plots & charts)

Seaborn – Advanced statistical visualizations

📈 Project Objective

To analyze Diwali sales data in order to:

Understand customer demographics and buying behavior

Identify top-performing states, occupations, and categories

Provide business insights to improve festive sales campaigns

🔍 Key Analysis Areas

Most Purchased Product Categories

Identified which categories generated the highest sales (e.g., Food, Clothing, Electronics).

Gender-wise Purchasing Trends

Compared spending behavior between male and female customers.

State-wise Purchase Behavior

Analyzed which states contributed the most to overall sales (e.g., Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka).

Marital Status of Customers

Segmented customers by married vs. unmarried to understand purchasing trends.

Professional Background of Buyers

Highlighted which professions (IT, Aviation, Healthcare, etc.) spent the most during Diwali.

📊 Major Findings

Married women are the most active buyers during Diwali sales.

Top states for purchases: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka.

Top professions: Buyers from IT, Aviation, and Healthcare sectors contributed significantly.

Preferred categories: Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most purchased items.

Spending patterns suggest higher family-oriented purchases during Diwali season.

🎯 Business Outcomes

Targeted Marketing: Businesses can focus campaigns on married women in high-performing states.

Product Strategy: Stocking up and promoting Food, Clothing, and Electronics during Diwali increases sales.

Customer Segmentation: Helps companies design offers tailored to specific age groups, genders, and professions.

🚀 Learning Outcomes
